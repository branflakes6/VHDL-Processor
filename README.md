# VHDL-Processor
This repostriory contains my VHDL implementation of a Microcoded Instruction Set Processor designed and built for a Computer Architecture class. The processor can perform basic arithmetic, logic and shifting operations as well as conditional and unconditional branching. Users can enter their machine code into memory and the micro-controller will perform these instructions.
